# Part 1.1
* **ACCOUNTNAME**: The name of the account (e.g., “gibson”). Any special characters in this string (like spaces) should be properly “URL-encoded”. (I have provided a urlEncode() function that you may use for this purpose.)
* **ISSUER**: The name of the service (e.g., “Facebook”). As with the previous field, all special characters must be encoded. (e.g., “U of T” becomes “U%20of%20T”.)

Not sure if we need to consider the **space** or not.

# Part 1.2
hmac has been correctly generated, still need TOTP to be done :)
